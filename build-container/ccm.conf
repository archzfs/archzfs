# Fully qualified path for build root.
# This should not use a variable like $HOME.  If your machine has lots

CHROOTPATH64="/scratch/.buildroot"

# Number of threads makepkg in the clean chroot will use when building.
# The typical rule is physical cores + 1.
THREADS=9

# Optionally uncomment and define a custom pacman.conf and/or a custom
# makepkg.conf for the buildroot using a fully qualified path below.
# Leaving these two undefined to use the system files.

# Optionally uncomment and define a custom location and name for the local chroot
# package repo.
#REPO="/src/repo"
REPO_NAME="chroot_local"

# Optionally uncomment to pass the --nocheck flag to the build which will skip
# the check function in the PKGBUILD is it is present.
#NOCHECK=1

# Optionally define the format of compression for compiled packages. Leave this
# undefined to use the Arch default.
PKGEXT=

# If set, the value defined will be used in the buildroot's packages.

# Set this variable to anything if you want to run namcap on the built package.
RUNNAMCAP=

# Set this to anything if you want makepkg to build using distcc for faster
# compilation. You must have distcc nodes properly configured on volunteers
# you define below.  It does NOT need to be running on the native environment.
#
# Alternatively, you can invoke ccm with the 'cd' flag to create the chroot
# with distcc enabled rather than editing this value.
#
# For more on distcc, see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Distcc
RUNDISTCC=

# This is only needed for users planning to build with distcc. Take care to
# include the localhost plus all volunteers you define below. As a rule of thumb,
# set to about twice the total number of available server CPUs. See the distcc
# man page for more info.
DISTCC_THREADS=

# Define all machines in the distcc cluster below using the distcc syntax of:
# "hostname/threads" and remember to list localhost/n first, followed by your
# volunteer nodes listed in decreasing order of CPU power. Additional supported
# options are passed through, see the manpage for distcc.
#
# In my experience, one sees best results using twice the number of physical
# cores on the volunteer machines. In the example below foo is a quad and bar
# is a dual.
#DISTCC_HOSTS="localhost/9 foo/8 bar/4"

# To build with ccache in the buildroot, uncomment and define the directory where
# ccache will store its data below.  If you're using a custom makepkg.conf
# (see below), you MUST enable ccache that file in addition to defining the path
# below. For more info about ccache, see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ccache
