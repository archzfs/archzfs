How to use this Repository
--------------------------

.. note:: All of these commands require the current directory to be the archzfs
          project directory.

1. Set the appropriate variables in conf.sh

   * Repository base path

     The parent directory of the ``demz-repo-core`` and ``demz-repo-archiso``
     repos.

   * GPG signing key

     Used to sign the packages and repo database.

   * Your email address

     Used for reporting changes changes in ``scraper.sh``. Mutt and msmtp are
     used for sending email. Required only if ``scraper.sh`` or ``verifier.sh``
     are going to be used.

   * Ssh remote login

     Used in ``verifier.sh`` for making sure the local ``demz-repo-*`` are in
     sync with the remote repos.

#. Set the appropriate kernel versions in conf.sh.

   If the any of the ``*_X*_PKGREL`` variables are changed in ``conf.sh`,` then
   ``AZB_PKGREL`` must be incremented as well. ``AZB_PKGREL`` controls the top
   level ``pkgrel`` inside the PKGBUILDS.

#. Update the PKGBUILDs

   Use ``./build update`` to update the PKGBUILDS using the ``conf.sh``
   variables.

   ``./build.sh update-test`` uses the ``AZB_LINUX_TEST_*`` variables. Using
   the test values are useful for test building the zfs packages against the
   Linux kernel version in the official testing repo. Mostly used on minor
   Linux kernel updates (3.12 -> 3.13).

#. Build the packages

   Use ``./build.sh make -u`` to build the packages, update the clean chroot in
   the process.

   It is possible to use ``./build.sh update make -u`` in one shot.

   If you want to see command output only, use ``./build.sh make -n``. Add the
   ``-d`` to see debugging output.

#. Add packages to the repo

   Use ``./repo.sh core -n`` to what changes will occur without actually making
   them.

   ``./repo.sh core`` will add the package versions defined by
   ``AZB_LINUX_VERSION`` to the ``demz-repo-core`` repository.

#. Push the package sources to AUR.

   Pushing to AUR using ``push.sh`` requires burp_.  Simply use ``./push.sh``
   to push the package sources by version (specified by ``AZB_LINUX_VERSION``)
   to AUR.
